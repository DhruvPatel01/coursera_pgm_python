Although the assignment is worth 90 marks,
due a bug at Coursera, triplet factor part fails in grader script,
(see: Discussions for this week).

Thus you will only be able to achieve 75 marks. Though this is enough for honors.

To see if your implementation was correct for that part, use `check.ipynb`.
